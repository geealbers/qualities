I have a tweet printed out and hung up on my office wall:

Though I make my living off PDFs and EPUBs and their bretheren, I had to answer in the negative. I have never loved an EPUB. Though I do love EPUB itself. (Or maybe love hate.)

I am a book publisher. I make public the writing, imagery and other media of (hopefully) fantastic authors. I am not a book printer. I am not defined by the format I choose to work on, but by the purpose that format serves. And the purpose is the same whether in hardcover, or paperback, or PDF or EPUB. The purpose is to "make public" these works. While I choose to work in digital tools because I think they're useful and relevant to readers, and an worthwhile pursuit for me, the core of my pursuit is books. Books in the broadest, modern sense of the word. The word Publications would probably be more accurate and encompassing, but it lacks the panache and passion of a book. 

- college letterpress something satisfying, permanent, real, detailed, fine craft, pride, feel of paper (interaction)
- (email at that time, modems, NeXT computer, browser wars, ebooks are today where net was then)
- jump ahead and looking at EPUB, by which I mean the underlying code and methodology. And I saw clearly many of those same qualities I first saw in the basement of Jackson House. Here was a human-readable package that contained the whole of the book. The setting of code, much the same as the setting of type. I wonder how many people out there have both lead type and html running through their veins? 
- EPUB did something other earlier formats had failed to do, it allowed publishers to "make public" digital books in a way that was more universal, open and sustainable. Mostly.
- So yes, I actually do love EPUB
- For its qualities as a publication format
- And that's what I'm attempting to do here, speak about tehe qualities of digital books. Of the special things that makes them worthy of love and attention, that defines them against other digital formats. 
â€“ Becasue EPUB is just one of many formats out there now, and more yet to come. SO our focus here is not on format, but on the qualties of books, and on the digital tools and approaches that make those books happen.
