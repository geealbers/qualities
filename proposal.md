### Overview

Outside of those imposed by particular publishing platforms like iBooksAuthor, the Kindle, and others, what are the qualities of digital publications that we should strive for as authors, designers, publishers, and readers? What universal ideals define a digital publication or book, as opposed to other digital media? The current e-book explosion, propelled first by Amazon's release of its Kindle reading device in 2007, is not even a decade old, but it is time we start to think more holisticaly about what it means to make and read e-books. Though device and software makers have so far been the dominant voices in establishing what an e-book is and how it operates, it is time for authors and publishers to make their own way, just as they have done successfully for print books for the past several centuries.

While there are numerous books and resources for web design, best practices, strategies and technologies, there is quite little focused on ebooks and digital publications. What books there are tend to focus on specific platforms and formats (EPUB, iBooksAuthor, Adobe DPS); specific areas like metadata or marketing; or are geared to a self-publishing audience simply looking for nuts-and-bolts how-to guides. There are no books out there that address the design and strategies of digital publications in a more in-depth way that would be applicable to a wider audience. No books showcasing the beauty of digital publication, or theorizing its place in the larger technological universe.
