Design is a key facet of all books. We apply good design to books because it helps our readers read them, it adds meaning, it sends a signal of quality, professionalism and intention separating the book between its raw manuscript form and the final form in which it is read. 

Design in digital books is not just about the end product, but also about the underlying way that product was achieved. The code and the resulting output.

We're going to speak here about the places where print book design and web design converge.

- relative measures
- typographic entities
- responsive design
- embedded fonts
- on using frameworks
- accessibility
- running heads / nav carrots
- pages (regions, columns, scroll)
- image handling

The more complicated and specific your design, the more chances for it to break.
